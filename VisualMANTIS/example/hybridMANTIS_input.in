0          # min. number of optical photons that can be detected
1400       # max. (N*yield) number of optical photons that can be detected
140        # number of bins for storing pulse height specturm (maximum value=1000)
909.0      # x-dimension of detector (in microns)
909.0      # y-dimension of detector (in microns)
150.0      # thickness of detector (in microns)
5.1        # column radius (in microns)
1.8        # refractive index of column material
1.0        # refractive index of inter-columnar material
