# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECTION CONFIG
#
# * The simulation will be finished when ANY of the following conditions is
#   fulfilled: i) the requested number of histories has been reached; ii) the
#   alloted time has been exhausted; or iii) ALL the requested relative
#   uncertainties have been reached.
#
# * Allotted time is interpreted as real time if it is a positive number.
#   Otherwise, CPU (i.e. user) time is assumed.
#
# * Similarly, the update period is interpreted as real time if it is positive;
#   otherwise it is the number of histories between updates. See the README file
#   for a description of the tasks performed during each update. Note that the
#   real time between updates cannot be larger than 50000 s.
#
# * Setting both random seeds equal to zero is an indication that they must be read
#   from an external file. The name of the file containing the seeds is read from
#   an additional input line that must be introduced after that of 'RANDOM SEEDS'.
#   This new line must have the following format:
#(rngseed.in                    ) RANDOM SEEDS FILE NAME (*** 30 characters ***)
#   In this example, the file 'rngseed.in' is opened and read. The two seeds must
#   be on the first line of rngseed.in, separated by one or more blanks. This
#   feature is useful when using parallel computing (see README file).

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECTION PENGEOM+PENVOX
#
# * Three possible geometry models can be simulated: (i) quadrics; (ii) voxels
#   (i.e. homogeneous parallelepipedic volume elements); and (iii) a mixture of
#   quadrics and voxels.
#
# * For case (i), provide a file name in the QUADRICS field and leave the VOXELS
#   field empty. The syntax of the quadrics file is described in the PENELOPE
#   documentation.
#
# * For case (ii), do the reverse, leaving the QUADRICS field empty. The format
#   of the voxels file is described in the file sample.vox included in this
#   distribution. The voxels bounding box (i.e. the parallelepiped that delimits
#   the set of voxels) is implicitly assumed to lie in the first octant of the
#   simulation reference frame, that is, in the region {x>0,y>0,z>0}, with one
#   of its corners located at the origin of coordinates. Its faces are therefore
#   parallel to either the xy, xz or yz planes.
#
# * For case (iii), provide both file names. In this case quadric bodies are
#   assumed to remove the voxels located "underneath", except for one body
#   that we shall call the voxels body. The voxels body can be thought of as a
#   "hole" in the quadric geometry through which voxels can be seen. The voxels
#   body is identified by the user by giving the material of which it is made (in
#   the field QUADRIC MATERIAL below). This material should not be present in any
#   other body of the whole quadric geometry. Note also that the voxels body
#   should not exceed in extension that of the parallelepipedic region where
#   voxels are located, as defined in the voxels file.
#
# * For quadric+voxel geometries, each voxel mass is evaluated during the
#   initialization by integrating density over voxel volume. The number of threads
#   that are cast (along the z axis) through each voxel to perform this
#   integration is determined by the value input in the GRANULARITY field. The
#   actual number of threads equals the granularity squared. A reasonable value
#   is 3; use larger values for spiky quadric geometries.
#
# * Note that vacuum bodies are NOT allowed inside the voxel region. This is to
#   prevent possible miscalculations of a voxels mass.

# * The MATERIAL FILE must be a valid PENELOPE material file.
#
# * If the number of MATERIALS EXPECTED is set to zero, then this numbers is set
#   automatically to the maximum material index found in the geometry files. The
#   simulation parameters are then set, for all materials, as follows:
#     - Eabs for electrons and positrons are both set to 1% of the initial source
#       energy (E), with the limiting values of 50 eV (min) and 1 MeV (max).
#     - Eabs for photons is set to 0.1% E with the limiting values of 50 eV and
#       1 MeV.
#     - C1 and C2 are both set to 0.1.
#     - WCC is set to min(Eabs(e-),1% E)
#     - WCR is set to min(Eabs(phot),0.1% E).
#     - DSMAX is set to infinity.
#   When this option is selected, the table header (MAT,EABS ... etc) and the
#   succeeding lines with the values of these parameters must all be removed.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TALLY SECTIONS
#
# * Details on the features and configuration of each tally are provided in their
#   accompanying documentation (see ~/documentation/*.txt).
#
# * The required RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY that is specified for each tally (except for
#   those that do not have an associated uncertainty, e.g. a phase-space file) is
#   used as a condition to stop the simulation. Only when the requested
#   relative uncertainties of *all* the tallies have been attained the uncertainty
#   condition is considered fulfilled. Recall that the simulation can also be
#   halted because the allotted time or the number of histories requested have
#   been reached. Setting the RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY of all tallies to zero will
#   prevent the execution from stopping for this cause.
#
# * Note for advanced users: when a certain tally scores nothing (i.e. zero) the
#   corresponding REPORT routine reports 0% uncertainty but, at the same time, it
#   reports that the requested uncertainty has not been reached, irrespective of
#   the value introduced in the input file. This is to prevent the simulation from
#   being stopped by a deceptive impression of accuracy in highly inefficient
#   simulations, where the score and its standard deviation after a short period
#   of time can be null.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE INTERACTION FORCING SECTION
#
# * Interaction forcing is a variance reduction technique. It is described
#   in detail in the PENELOPE manual. Use it judiciously.
#
# * Interaction forcing will only be applied if the particle's statistical
#   weight (variable WGHT in common /TRACK/ of PENELOPE) falls in the
#   specified interval [WMIN,WMAX], also known as the WEIGHT WINDOW.
#   Otherwise, analog simulation is employed.
#
# * It is advisable to define a prudent weight window [WMIN,WMAX], such as
#   [0.01,100], to prevent the occurrence of extreme statistical weights,
#   which may give rise to low simulation efficiencies and numerical precision
#   problems. Notice that a weight window such as [1.0,1.0] prevents the
#   repetitive application of interaction forcing to secondary particles
#   already generated in forced events.
#
# * One line must be entered for each combination of material and interaction
#   type for which interaction forcing is to be applied. The contents of
#   this line is:
#   - Material number (MAT).
#   - Particle type (KPAR). KPAR=1,2,3 is for electrons, photons and positrons,
#     respectively.
#   - Type of interaction (ICOL), see list of values below.
#     By setting ICOL=0 all interactions are forced by the same amount.
#   - Forcing factor (FORCING) by which the mean free path of interactions
#     ICOL will be divided when particles of type KPAR are in material MAT.
#
# * PENELOPE labels the interaction mechanisms in the following way:
#      Electrons (KPAR=1) and positrons (KPAR=3):
#         ICOL = 1 artificial soft event (hinge).
#              = 2 hard elastic collision.
#              = 3 hard inelastic collision.
#              = 4 hard bremsstrahlung emission.
#              = 5 inner-shell ionization.
#              = 6 positron annihilation.
#              = 7 delta interaction.
#              = 8 'auxiliary' fictitious interactions.
#      Photons (KPAR=2):
#         ICOL = 1 coherent (Rayleigh) scattering.
#              = 2 incoherent (Compton) scattering.
#              = 3 photoelectric absorption.
#              = 4 electron-positron pair production.
#              = 7 delta interaction.
#              = 8 'auxiliary' fictitious interactions.
#
# * The last entered line (before END of SECTION) must have MAT=0, which
#   signals the end of the list.
#
# * Beware of the fact that the use of interaction forcing may bias tallies
#   based on pulse height spectra.
